swagger-integration-examples
============================

Examples of using Swagger with Spring MVC, client libraries, validations, routing rules and other entirely good stuff.

Why should I care?
Good question.  Primarly if you are trying to integrate Swagger (v1.2) with a SpringMVC API project, as that's the example I have in here. Looking at the recordshop example you can see how to annotate an api, how to include the project references, swagger springmvc configuration, etc.  

PLUS!
The example shows a swagger client that is generated via spec.  As this is (IMHO) the true power of a API spec I wanted to provide a working example.

And finally, for those of us using SpringMVC who've had the problem of a ResponseEntity<some_class> generating in our spec - this example shows how to easily (and properly) avoid that.

If you have questions of issues please use the Github issues and I'll get back to you.
